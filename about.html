            <h2>About Matthew Guptill</h2>
            <p>Matthew is a programmer hailing from nashville TN. His journey towards programming started in April of 2022 and has been progressing 
                smoothly through the Codecademy course since that time. His purpose in getting into programming was the 
                that he is a creative person who can bring many different and interesting ideas to the programing field.
                Where he lacks in programming knowledge and experience (as of right now) he makes up for it in creativity
                and inovation. Matthew is a hard working person who won't ever abandon a project or task because it was too hard,
                he will work at it until it is finished and polished to perfection.
